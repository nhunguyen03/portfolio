● The goal is to **understand site performance, customer engagement, and retention trends** by exploring **eCommerce
dataset**. Calculating total visits, pageviews, transactions, revenue, etc. Building a **cohort map** for customer retention
and analyzing average spending and transactions.

applying data modeling and DAX for key calculations. The outcome is increasing discounts and flexible payment for
the Loyal segment, which drives **$44 million** in revenue but represents just **0.5% of the size**.
